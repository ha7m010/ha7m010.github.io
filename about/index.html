The second thing that I appreciated was the rotated floral heart bullet behind the title of each page, i.e.,</p><div style=font-size:9em;text-align:center;color:#ccc>❧</div><p>So I wrote a Hugo theme that mimics the style of the paged.js website. I tried not to look at its HTML/CSS source code, but I had to read the source to figure out:</p><ol><li>How the crop marks were made with CSS (a very clever trick that I&rsquo;d never thought of);</li><li>What the floral heart symbol really was (I&rsquo;d never know this dingbat);</li><li>The fonts (<a href=https://github.com/theleagueof/linden-hill>Linden Hill</a> and <a href=https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost>Jost</a>).</li></ol><p>The rest of HTML and CSS code was written from scratch (well, not really&mdash;from <a href=https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin>the Hugo XMin theme</a>). The code is fairly lightweight and hopefully easy for users to understand, tweak, or adapt.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to thank paged.js developers for their great piece of work, without which I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to create this theme.</p><p>I hope this theme won&rsquo;t be widely known or used because I&rsquo;m currently using it for my own website&mldr;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> but I&rsquo;m all for open source, so <a href=https://github.com/yihui/hugo-paged>here you go</a>! If you decide to use this theme, I encourage you to tweak the CSS to make your site look at least a little different.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>When I was developing <a href=https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown>the <strong>pagedown</strong> package</a> in R.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Paged.js developers are more generous than me.
